## Usage

### Creating a virtual machine

0. Adjust the parameters in the `.env` file as needed
0. Execute `vagrant up` - note that this will take quite some time so have some chocolate in the meantime
0. Check `POST-INSTALL-TASKS.MD` for tasks you might have to do manually because it they are not automated by vagrant

### Updating an existing virtual machine

There are multiple options to update an existing machine:

* Use `run-playbook.sh $playbook` to execute a single playbook e.g. `run-playbook.sh shell` or `run-playbook.sh all`
* Use `update-tag.sh $tag` to update a specific tag e.g. `update-tag.sh packages`
* Use `update-config.sh` to update all configuration
